# MARS-Trans: Multistage Attention Region Supplement Transformer for Fine-grained Visual Categorization

An improved model with Vision Transformer as the backbone called MARS-Trans is now used in Fine-grained Visual Categorization and has achieved competitive results across multiple FGVC public datasets. In particular, SOTA was achieved on the Stanford Cars dataset.

## Introduction
"MARS-Trans" is a variant model of the Vision Transformer proposed by the Big Data Analysis Lab of the School of Information Engineering, Henan University of Science and Technology.

## Applications

### ðŸŒ… Fine-grained Visual Categorization Tasks

"MARS-Trans" achieved competitive results on multiple FGVC public datasets and State-of-The-Art results on Stanford-Cars datasets. Performed well on the large dataset iNaturalist 2017, second only to the SIM-Trans model.

**Performance**
 - "MARS-Trans" is mainly improved in three parts: MAM,RSM and AAM. The following table shows the impact of each part on model performance.
